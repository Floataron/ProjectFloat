# Small POC for a First Person game with Three.js and Cannon.es
An attempt on creating a game using Three.js and Cannon.es.

Made two executables, one for Mac and one for Windows. Which can be found in the release tab.

Tried to create a small gameplay loop with UI and timer. 

How fast can you reach the top part?
